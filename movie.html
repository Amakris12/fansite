    <p>The flash is a fan favorite for many people when it comes to the DC universe. He is not on the same level as Batman or Superman as of popularity but he is definitly
        in a tier below them. For example he has never been in his own solo movie but he is featured in almost every other movie in the DC Universe, for example; he is featured 
        in Batman v Superman. In the film he is shown coming out of a portal tell Bruce Wayne(Batman) that Lois is the key. Bruce at the time did not know what this meant but during
        the film the "Justice League", Superman has just been reborn and he is not the same. He is the oppistie of what he once was, he resembled hope to the people. But for this short 
        stint he is the darkest version of superman there has ever been. He didnt kill anyone(Even though he couldve killed everyone there with ease), he just beats everyone up. 
        One of the funniest moments came during this part of the movie. The whole justice league is trying to stop superman and everyone is trying to punch him and tackle him. He doesnt
        move once. The Flash being known as the "Fastest Man alive" used his super speed to suprise superman from the back. But he did not know superman was just as fast. Superman turns around 
        and trips the flash and watchs him fly into a wall. Anyways the flash also has been in tv shows, weather that be the one from the 1990s or the current version which has been on since
        2014. He is one of DCs most popular superheros. Luckly for us he is getting a solo movie that is coming out 2022!    </p>
